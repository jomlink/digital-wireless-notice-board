# digital-wireless-notice-board
Notice boards are commonly used in a variety of institutions which we come across on a daily
basis. In the present generation the advertisement notice boards are being managed manually. This
wastes a lot of resources like paper, printer ink, manpower and also brings the loss of time. In this
paper we have proposed a system that will wirelessly transmit notices on a Liquid Crystal display
(LCD) using Wi-Fi. An authorized user sends the notice via a smartphone or personal computer
using a client based server over the Wi-Fi network towards the raspberry pi. Raspberry pi receives
the notice and stores it in its memory and then display the text according to the program. The notice
can be modified and altered according to client needs. Having studied the existing systems, the
preferred model that will be used in this project is the Reuse Oriented Model. This paper provides
an efficient way of displaying text on the LCD and also provides user authentication in order to
avoid any misuse of proposed system.

PROBLEM

Institutions face a lot of challenges regarding the dissemination of information to the intended
masses, in this discipline, the student populous at the Copperbelt University. Putting notices on
conventional notice boards requires effort being made by a separate person, who has to go and
attach notices manually on it, this also requires time to type the document and printing which is
wasting the paper and ink resources. Overtime when the notices outdate, students usually teardown
the papers leaving the notice board surroundings cluttered with paper, moreover conventional
notice boards do not display content clearly at night, unless light shines on it (Roslilee. A, Faizan.
A. J, Siti. A. M, Ilyani. A & Norliwa. A, 2011).
By developing an alternative notice board model, we attempt to provide a solution to the above
general problem. This model will autonomously work, by displaying notices in the form of text.

OBJECTIVES
The main objective is to design a reliable wireless notice board. Below are specific objectives:
1. To develop a system that displays information on an LCD.
2. To develop a system that can remotely update notice board information based on priority.
3. To develop a system that will be able to display formatted data when displayed on the LCD
screen
